# Python Practice Projects

Welcome to my Python practice repository! This is a collection of small, console-based projects aimed at helping me enhance my Python programming skills. Each project is a simple but effective way to dive into Python concepts, improve problem-solving abilities, and practice coding techniques.

## Projects List

- **Dice Rolling Game**: A simple game where the user rolls a virtual dice.
- **Number Guessing Game**: The program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it.

## How to Use

Each project is designed to run in the terminal or console. Simply clone the repository, navigate to the desired project folder, and run the Python script using:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Feel free to explore and modify the code to fit your learning process!

## Contributing
This is a practice repository, but if you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, feel free to fork the repo and open a pull request.


You can copy and paste this directly into your `README.md` file for proper formatting on GitHub.
